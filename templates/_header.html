				CC Calc
			</h1>
			<p>
				This very simple calculator will help you decide on your chances in a fight. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The CC-Calculator is a purely a project of interest. And IÂ´m doing it to explore AngularJS in a "real" project, as oposed to doing tutorials where every answer is given in advance. 
			<br />
			It happens so, that I love a great challenge and especially to get aquinted with new technologies and frameworks. <br /><br />
