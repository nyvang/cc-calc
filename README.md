cc-calc
=======

Crime City fight-calculator. Intended to help people figure out the fight outcome as of CC version 6.0

Calculations are based purely on my own knowledge of CC and have no input from Gree in any way.

The estimations are based on time from the release of the CC v.6 update, and is only to be seen as guidelines 
for future CC events. 

Also, be aware that this is a very simple calculator, which is made in a few hours in the init version :)
