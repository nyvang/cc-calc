cc-calc
=======

Crime City fight-calculator. Intended to help people figure out the fight outcome as of CC version 6.0

Calculations are based purely on my own knowledge of CC and have no input from Gree in any way.

The estimations are based on time from the release of the CC v.6 update, and is only to be seen as guidelines for future CC events. 

Also, be aware that this is a very simple calculator, which is made in a few hours in the init version :)

NOTE af of 06. Januar 2015: 
There has been rapid changes to the events giving ACC & KP "items". This means, that the way this application calculates is now outdated. 
Its is completely impossible to say how many points one can have, and hence, how big a chance one would have against another. 

However, since im doing thid for my own pure interest in webdevelopment, and in this project, AngularJS, IÂ´ll keep working on it.
